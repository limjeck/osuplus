## Prerequisites
- Tampermonkey (for Chrome) or Greasemonkey (for Firefox)

## How to install
1. Ensure you have Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey installed and enabled. 
1. Go to https://github.com/limjeck/osuplus/raw/master/osuplus.user.js. Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey will automatically open a tab, prompting you to install the userscript. Install it.
1. On Chromium browsers, userscripts may not run properly without enabling Developer Mode. If necessary, enable Developer Mode for your browser (for Tampermonkey users, see https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q209)
1. Go to any osu webpage. There should be a big red banner at the top prompting you to use your osu!API key.
1. To get your osu!API key, go to https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api or https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit#legacy-api.
   1. Under the "Legacy API" section, click "New Legacy API Key +".
   1. Put "osuplus" as application name and "https://github.com/limjeck/osuplus" as application url.
   1. Click "Show Key" to reveal your api key. Copy the key.
1. Use your api key by clicking the "here" in the red banner. Paste your api key when prompted.

## FAQ
- I don't see the red banner or the cogs settings!
  - Make sure you have Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey installed and enabled. Make sure Developer Mode is enabled so that the userscript is allowed to inject codes (see https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q209 for details and instructions).
- My question is not in this FAQ!
  - You may ask any additional questions in the Discord server.
